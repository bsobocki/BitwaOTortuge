Ships with black sails belong to the pirate fleet and with red - to the spain fleet.

At the beggining of the game every pawn is randomly set and reversed.

### move
Every move can be just one of activities:
  - When pawn is reserved:
    * inversion the pawn and setting it in any position,
  - If pawn is exposed:
    * turn to the left or right by 90 degrees,
    * move the pawn according to the dots on it
